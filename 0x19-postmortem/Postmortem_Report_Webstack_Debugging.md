Postmortem: Unexpected Database Outage

Issue Summary:

Duration: The outage lasted from May 5, 2024, 14:00 UTC to May 5, 2024, 17:45 UTC.
Impact: Our primary database service experienced a slowdown, followed by a complete outage. Users reported timeouts and error messages when accessing their dashboards. Approximately 65% of our user base was affected.
Root Cause: A misconfigured database migration script led to excessive memory consumption, causing the service to crash.
Timeline:

14:00 UTC: Issue detected by our monitoring system alerting about high memory usage.
14:05 UTC: Incident commander assigned, initial assumption was a memory leak in the application code.
14:30 UTC: Investigation revealed no memory leaks; attention turned to recent changes in the database.
15:00 UTC: A recently applied database schema migration identified as the potential cause.
15:45 UTC: Misleading path pursued, checking for external security breaches.
16:30 UTC: Database team escalated the issue after ruling out security issues.
17:45 UTC: Rollback of the migration script resolved the incident.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Cause: The outage was caused by a database migration script that lacked proper memory allocation checks, leading to uncontrolled memory consumption.
Resolution: The faulty script was rolled back, and the database was restored to its previous stable state.
Corrective and Preventive Measures:

Improvements: Implementing stricter code review processes for database-related changes.
Tasks:
Review and update all database migration scripts with memory checks.
Enhance monitoring to include specific database performance metrics.
Conduct a thorough audit of recent database changes.
Schedule a drill for incident response team on database recovery procedures.
Patch database management system to the latest stable version.
Add automated rollback capabilities for high-risk changes.
